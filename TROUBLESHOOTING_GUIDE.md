# Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue 1: AI-Generated Descriptions Are Too Short

### Problem
The outfit descriptions in recommendations are only one sentence instead of the required three sentences.

### Solution Applied
1. **Schema Validation Enhanced**: Added `.min(100, 'Description must be at least 100 characters')` to the Zod schema to enforce minimum length.

2. **Prompt Instructions Strengthened**: Updated the prompt with explicit requirements:
   ```
   MANDATORY - EXACTLY 3 COMPLETE SENTENCES (minimum 100 characters)
   - Sentence 1: Describe the overall look and key pieces
   - Sentence 2: Explain styling details and how pieces work together  
   - Sentence 3: Highlight versatility, occasions, or why it's perfect for the user
   ```

3. **Examples Added**: Included both correct and incorrect examples in the prompt to guide the AI:
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "Great casual look with jeans and a sweater." (Only 1 sentence)
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "This casual weekend look pairs dark wash jeans with a cozy cream knit sweater. The relaxed fit is elevated with structured accessories and ankle boots in cognac brown. Perfect for brunch, shopping, or casual Friday at the office."

### Testing
After these changes, test by:
1. Go to the Style Check page
2. Upload an image and get recommendations
3. Verify each outfit description has exactly 3 sentences
4. If still seeing short descriptions, check the browser console for any Zod validation errors

## Issue 2: Liked Recommendations Not Displaying on Likes Page

### Problem
When users like outfits, they appear to save successfully (toast notifications show), but the Likes page shows no outfits.

### Possible Causes & Solutions

#### Cause 1: Firestore Index Not Deployed
**Symptom**: Console shows Firestore error about missing index

**Solution**:
```bash
# Deploy Firestore indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Or use the npm script
npm run deploy:firestore
```

**Verification**: Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Indexes tab to confirm the `likedOutfits` index is active.

#### Cause 2: Firestore Rules Not Deployed
**Symptom**: Console shows "permission-denied" errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Verification**: Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules tab to confirm rules are deployed.

#### Cause 3: Authentication Issue
**Symptom**: User ID is null or "anonymous"

**Solution**:
1. Sign out and sign in again
2. Check browser console for authentication errors
3. Verify Firebase Auth is properly configured in Firebase Console

**Debugging**:
- Open browser console on the Likes page
- Look for logs showing: `üîç Fetching liked outfits for user: [userId]`
- If userId is missing or "anonymous", there's an auth issue

#### Cause 4: Data Not Actually Being Saved
**Symptom**: No data in Firestore database

**Solution**:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
2. Navigate to: `users ‚Üí [your-user-id] ‚Üí likedOutfits`
3. Check if documents exist

If no documents exist:
- Check browser console when clicking the Like button
- Look for error messages in the `saveLikedOutfit` function
- Verify the outfit data is valid (has title and imageUrl)

#### Cause 5: Client-Side Caching Issue
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear browser cache and hard reload
# Chrome: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
# Or clear all browser data for the site
```

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Browser Console on Likes Page**:
   - Look for: `‚úÖ Fetched outfits: X valid outfits`
   - If X = 0, check Firestore database directly
   - Look for any error messages

2. **Check Browser Console When Liking an Outfit**:
   - Look for: `‚úÖ Outfit saved successfully with ID: [doc-id]`
   - Look for: `üîó Document path: users/[userId]/likedOutfits/[doc-id]`
   - If you see errors, read the error message carefully

3. **Check Firebase Console**:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Navigate to `users` collection
   - Find your user ID (check console logs for the exact ID)
   - Look inside the `likedOutfits` subcollection
   - Verify documents exist with proper data

4. **Verify Data Structure**:
   Each liked outfit document should have:
   ```json
   {
     "imageUrl": "https://...",
     "title": "Outfit name",
     "description": "Three sentence description...",
     "items": ["item1", "item2", ...],
     "colorPalette": ["#RRGGBB", "#RRGGBB", ...],
     "shoppingLinks": {
       "amazon": null,
       "ajio": null,
       "myntra": null
     },
     "likedAt": 1234567890,
     "recommendationId": "rec-id"
   }
   ```

5. **Development Debug Panel**:
   - In development mode, a debug panel appears in the top-left of the Likes page
   - Shows: User ID, outfit count, loading state, auth state
   - Use this to quickly verify authentication and data loading

### Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Signed in with Google account (not anonymous)
- [ ] Firestore indexes deployed (`npm run deploy:firestore`)
- [ ] Firestore rules deployed (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`)
- [ ] Browser console shows successful save logs
- [ ] Firebase Console shows documents in `users/[userId]/likedOutfits`
- [ ] Browser cache cleared and page hard-reloaded
- [ ] No errors in browser console on Likes page

### Still Not Working?

If you've checked all the above and it still doesn't work:

1. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Filter by "firestore" 
   - Look for failed requests (red)
   - Check the response for error messages

2. **Check Firebase Status**:
   - Visit https://status.firebase.google.com/
   - Verify Firestore is operational

3. **Test with Firebase Emulator** (for development):
   ```bash
   # Install Firebase tools
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Initialize emulators
   firebase init emulators
   
   # Start emulators
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

4. **Re-deploy Everything**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Console Log Reference

**When Saving a Like** (successful):
```
üíæ Attempting to save outfit to likes...
üîç saveLikedOutfit called with: { userId: "...", hasTitle: true, ... }
üìÅ Creating Firestore reference: users/[userId]/likedOutfits
üîç Checking for duplicates...
üíæ Saving outfit to Firestore...
‚úÖ Outfit saved successfully with ID: [doc-id]
üîó Document path: users/[userId]/likedOutfits/[doc-id]

```

**When Loading Likes Page** (successful):
```
üîç Fetching liked outfits for user: [userId]
üìä Found X liked outfits in database
‚úÖ Successfully fetched X valid liked outfits
```

**Error Patterns to Look For**:
- `‚ùå Invalid userId:` - Authentication problem
- `‚ùå Permission denied` - Firestore rules not deployed
- `‚ùå Missing index` - Firestore indexes not deployed  
- `‚ùå Invalid outfit data` - Data validation failed
- `‚ùå Error fetching liked outfits` - Database read failed

## General Tips

1. **Always Check Browser Console First**: Most issues will show clear error messages in the console.

2. **Verify Firebase Configuration**: Ensure all `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` environment variables are set in `.env.local`.

3. **Development vs Production**: Some features require deployment to work correctly. Test in production after deployment.

4. **Clear Cache Frequently**: When testing Firebase changes, clear your browser cache to avoid stale data.

5. **Check Firebase Quotas**: If you've hit your free tier limits, some operations may fail. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Usage tab.
