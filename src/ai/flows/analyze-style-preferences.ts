Warm cognac browns (#8B4513) and champagne golds (#F5DEB3) catch light beautifully against your complexion. Cool white (#F8F8F8) creates crispness, while dusty rose (#C4A69F) adds a soft, flattering accent. These colors work harmoniously together and can be mixed endlessly for various occasions."

- "Your ${input.skinTone} skin tone glows in jewel tones - don't hesitate to wear deep emeralds, sapphires, and rich burgundies"
- "Invest in one statement blazer in a bold color - it instantly elevates jeans and a white tee from casual to polished"
- "Layer different textures (smooth silk, nubby knit, crisp cotton) in similar colors for sophisticated monochrome looks"
