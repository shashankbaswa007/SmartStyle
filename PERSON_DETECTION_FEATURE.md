# Person Detection & Image Validation Feature

## Overview
Implemented AI-powered person detection to prevent invalid images (like benches, landscapes, etc.) from being submitted for style analysis.

## What Was Added

### 1. Image Validation Library (`src/lib/image-validation.ts`)
Two main functions:

#### `validateImageForStyleAnalysis(imageDataUri: string)`
- **Uses**: Gemini Vision API for intelligent person detection
- **Checks**:
  - Is there a person in the image?
  - Is clothing clearly visible?
  - Is the image quality sufficient (confidence > 60%)?
- **Returns**: Validation result with confidence score and detailed message

#### `validateImageProperties(file: File)`
- **Client-side validation** (instant feedback):
  - File size check (max 10MB)
  - File type check (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)

### 2. Multi-Layer Validation System

```
Level 1: Client-side (instant)
├─ File size validation
├─ File type validation
└─ Basic property checks

Level 2: AI-powered (2-3 seconds)
├─ Person detection
├─ Clothing visibility check
├─ Confidence scoring (0-100%)
└─ Quality assessment
```

### 3. User Experience Enhancements

#### Visual Feedback
- ⚠️ **Error Alert**: Shows when image is invalid (red alert with icon)
- ⏳ **Loading Alert**: Shows during validation (blue alert with spinner)
- ✅ **Success Toast**: Shows validation success with confidence score

#### Smart Rejection Scenarios

| Scenario | Detection | User Message |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Bench/Furniture | ❌ No person | "Image shows a bench with no person. Please upload a photo of yourself." |
| Landscape/Nature | ❌ No person | "No person detected. Please upload a photo wearing an outfit." |
| Face-only selfie | ⚠️ Person but no outfit | "Person detected but clothing is not clearly visible." |
| Blurry image | ⚠️ Low confidence | "Image quality is too low for accurate analysis." |
| Valid outfit photo | ✅ Passed | "Image validated! Ready for analysis. (Confidence: 95%)" |

### 4. UI State Management

#### New State Variables
```typescript
const [isValidatingImage, setIsValidatingImage] = useState(false);
const [imageValidationError, setImageValidationError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

#### Button States
- **Upload/Camera buttons**: Disabled during validation
- **Capture button**: Disabled during validation
- **Submit button**: Disabled if:
  - Image is being validated
  - Validation failed
  - Weather data is loading
  - Analysis is in progress

### 5. Integration Points

#### Image Upload Flow
```
1. User selects file
2. Client-side validation (size, type)
3. AI validation (person detection)
4. If valid: Extract colors + enable submit
5. If invalid: Show error + clear preview + disable submit
```

#### Camera Capture Flow
```
1. User captures photo
2. Stop camera stream
3. AI validation (person detection)
4. If valid: Extract colors + enable submit
5. If invalid: Show error + don't set preview
```

#### Submit Prevention
```typescript
const onSubmit = async (values) => {
  if (imageValidationError) {
    toast({
      variant: "destructive",
      title: "Cannot proceed",
      description: imageValidationError,
    });
    return; // Blocks submission
  }
  // ... rest of analysis
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Gemini API Prompt
```javascript
{
  "hasPerson": boolean,
  "confidence": number (0-100),
  "reason": string,
  "clothing_visible": boolean
}
```

### Validation Logic
```typescript
if (!hasPerson) return { isValid: false, message: "No person detected" };
if (!clothing_visible) return { isValid: false, message: "Clothing not visible" };
if (confidence < 60) return { isValid: false, message: "Image quality too low" };
return { isValid: true, message: "Ready for analysis" };
```

### Graceful Degradation
If the validation API fails:
- Error is logged
- Image is allowed to proceed (prevents blocking user)
- Toast shows "Validation skipped - proceeding with analysis"

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Cases to Verify

1. **Upload a photo of a bench**
   - ❌ Should reject with "No person detected"
   - Preview should not appear
   - Submit button should be disabled

2. **Upload a landscape photo**
   - ❌ Should reject with "No person detected"
   - Clear error message displayed

3. **Upload a close-up face selfie**
   - ⚠️ Should reject with "Clothing not clearly visible"
   - Person detected but outfit analysis not possible

4. **Upload a blurry person photo**
   - ⚠️ Should reject if confidence < 60%
   - Message about image quality

5. **Upload a clear outfit photo**
   - ✅ Should pass validation
   - Show success toast with confidence score
   - Enable submit button

6. **Capture photo with camera**
   - Same validation applies
   - Works identically to file upload

## Benefits

1. **Prevents wasted API calls** - No analysis on invalid images
2. **Better user experience** - Clear feedback on why image was rejected
3. **Improved accuracy** - Only processes images with visible people and clothing
4. **Smart validation** - AI-powered detection is more reliable than simple checks
5. **Graceful degradation** - System continues to work even if validation fails

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### Dependencies
- `@google/generative-ai` - For Gemini Vision API access
- Already installed in the project

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Add pose detection** - Ensure person is standing/visible
2. **Add clothing type detection** - Ensure appropriate clothing for analysis
3. **Add background blur detection** - Prefer clear backgrounds
4. **Cache validation results** - Avoid re-validating same images
5. **Add manual override** - Allow advanced users to skip validation

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/lib/image-validation.ts` - NEW FILE (validation logic)
2. ✅ `src/components/style-advisor.tsx` - Updated (integration)
3. ✅ `src/components/ui/alert.tsx` - Already exists (used for alerts)

## Summary

This feature ensures that only appropriate images (containing people with visible clothing) are submitted for style analysis, preventing confusion from images of benches, landscapes, or other non-person subjects. The validation happens automatically and provides clear, actionable feedback to users.
