## ‚úÖ Completed Enhancements

### 1. üõçÔ∏è **Tavily E-commerce Search - Gender Specification**

#### Problem:
- Tavily searches for shopping links were not specifying gender
- E-commerce results were generic and not gender-specific
- Users could get irrelevant shopping recommendations

#### Solution Implemented:

**File: `/src/lib/tavily.ts`**

**Before:**
```typescript
const enhancedQuery = `${genderPrefix}${upperHalfItem} ${fashionCategory} buy online India`;
console.log(`üîç Tavily search query (upper-half): "${enhancedQuery}"`);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Build specific query for upper-half fashion WITH GENDER
const genderPrefix = gender ? `${gender} ` : '';
const genderSuffix = gender ? ` for ${gender}` : '';
const fashionCategory = 'fashion upper wear';

// Enhanced query with gender specification for better e-commerce results
const enhancedQuery = `${genderPrefix}${upperHalfItem} ${fashionCategory}${genderSuffix} buy online India`;

console.log(`üîç Tavily search query (with gender): "${enhancedQuery}"`);
console.log(`   Gender: ${gender || 'not specified'}`);
```

**Example Query:**
- Before: `"blue shirt fashion upper wear buy online India"`
- After: `"male blue shirt fashion upper wear for male buy online India"`

#### Additional Changes:

1. **Updated `StyleAdvisorResults` component** (`src/components/style-advisor-results.tsx`):
   - Added `gender?` prop to interface
   - Updated `findSimilar` function to accept and pass gender parameter
   - Added gender logging for debugging

2. **Updated `StyleAdvisor` component** (`src/components/style-advisor.tsx`):
   - Passes `gender` from `lastAnalysisRequest` to `StyleAdvisorResults`
   - Gender is captured from user form input

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ E-commerce searches now include gender specification
- ‚úÖ More relevant shopping links for Amazon, Myntra, and Ajio
- ‚úÖ Better user experience with gender-appropriate recommendations

### 2. üé≠ **Pollinations.ai - Mannequin Generation**

#### Problem:

### 3. üìù **Outfit Descriptions - 3 Sentence Minimum**

**1. Updated Schema Definition:**

```typescript
// BEFORE:
description: z.string().optional().describe('A short description of the outfit.')

  - Sentence 1: Describe the overall look and key pieces
  - Sentence 2: Explain styling details and how pieces work together
  - Sentence 3: Highlight versatility, occasions, or why it's perfect for the user
  - Example: "This sophisticated ensemble combines a tailored navy blazer with crisp white trousers for effortless elegance. The structured silhouette is softened with a silk blouse in dusty rose, creating perfect balance. Perfect for business meetings or dinner dates, this outfit transitions seamlessly from day to evening."
```

**Before Example:**
```json
{
  "description": "A casual chic outfit."
}
```

  "description": "This sophisticated ensemble combines a tailored navy blazer with crisp white trousers for effortless elegance.
