## Common Issues & Solutions

### Analytics Page

#### Issue: "No Analytics Yet" despite using the app
**Cause**: User preferences or history not saved
**Solution**:
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Look for: `userPreferences/{userId}` and `users/{userId}/recommendationHistory/`
3. If missing, use Style Advisor and provide feedback
4. Analytics appear after first feedback submission

#### Issue: Error loading analytics
**Cause**: Firestore rules not deployed or auth issue
**Solution**:
```bash
npm run deploy:firestore
```
Then clear cache and reload

#### Issue: Metrics show as 0
**Cause**: No feedback provided on recommendations
**Solution**: 
- Go to Style Check
- Get recommendations
- Click "I liked this" on outfits
- Return to Analytics

### Likes Page

#### Issue: No outfits displayed despite liking them
**Cause**: Index not deployed or auth issue
**Solution**:
```bash
npm run deploy:firestore
```
Check Firebase Console for data in `users/{userId}/likedOutfits/`

#### Issue: "Permission denied" error
**Cause**: Not signed in or Firestore rules not deployed
**Solution**:
1. Sign out and sign in again
2. Deploy rules: `npm run deploy:firestore`
3. Clear browser cache

#### Issue: Outfits show but images don't load
**Cause**: Image URLs expired or invalid
**Solution**: This is expected for generated images (they may expire). The outfit data is preserved.

## Authentication Flow

Both pages use the **ProtectedRoute** component:

```tsx
// Wraps page content
<ProtectedRoute>
  {/* Page content */}
</ProtectedRoute>
```

**How it works**:
1. Checks if user is authenticated via `useAuth()` hook
2. Shows loading spinner while checking auth
3. Redirects to `/auth` if not authenticated
4. Renders page content only if authenticated

**Benefits**:
- Automatic redirect for unauthenticated users
- No flash of unauthorized content
- Consistent auth handling across protected pages

## Data Sources

### Analytics Page Data:

| Data Source | Firestore Path | Purpose |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| User Preferences | `userPreferences/{userId}` | Favorite colors, styles, preferences |
| Recommendation History | `users/{userId}/recommendationHistory/` | Past recommendations and feedback |
| Style Insights | Calculated from above | Aggregated analytics |

### Likes Page Data:

| Data Source | Firestore Path | Purpose |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Liked Outfits | `users/{userId}/likedOutfits/` | Saved outfit recommendations |
