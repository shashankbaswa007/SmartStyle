   - Go to http://localhost:3000/style-check
   - Sign in if prompted

2. **Generate Recommendations:**
   - Upload an outfit image
   - Wait for 3 recommendations to generate

3. **Test First Recommendation:**
   - Click "Like" button on the **FIRST** outfit
   - ✅ **Expected:** Button changes to "Liked ✓" with green border
   - ✅ **Expected:** Toast shows "Added to Favorites! ❤️"
   - 📊 **Check Console:** Look for `✅ Outfit saved to likes collection`

4. **Test Second Recommendation:**
   - Click "Like" button on the **SECOND** outfit
   - ✅ **Expected:** Button changes to "Liked ✓" with green border
   - ✅ **Expected:** Toast shows "Added to Favorites! ❤️"
   - 📊 **Check Console:** Look for `✅ Outfit saved to likes collection`

5. **Test Third Recommendation:**
   - Click "Like" button on the **THIRD** outfit
   - ✅ **Expected:** Button changes to "Liked ✓" with green border
   - ✅ **Expected:** Toast shows "Added to Favorites! ❤️"
   - 📊 **Check Console:** Look for `✅ Outfit saved to likes collection`

6. **Verify Likes Page:**

   - ✅ **Expected:** Each outfit shows:
     - Correct image

     ✅ Successfully loaded 3 liked outfits
     ```

### ❌ Before Fix (Bug Behavior):

## Test 2: Static Imports (No Hydration Errors) 🔄

### Steps:

1. **Test Likes Page:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/likes

   - Open Console
   - ✅ **Expected:** NO hydration errors

   - ✅ **Expected:** SplashCursor effects work
   - ✅ **Expected:** Particles animate in background

3. **Test Color Match Page:**

   - ✅ **Expected:** Particles animate in background

### Common Hydration Errors to Watch For:

❌ Text content does not match server-rendered HTML
❌ There was an error while hydrating
```

### ✅ If you see NONE of these errors, the static imports are working correctly!

## Console Logging Guide 📊

### When Liking an Outfit:
```javascript
❤️ User liked outfit { outfitIndex: 0, outfitTitle: "..." }
💾 Attempting to save outfit to likes...
✅ Outfit saved to likes collection
📊 Save liked outfit result: { success: true, ... }
✅ Outfit selection tracked successfully!
```

### When Loading Likes Page:
```javascript
🔍 Fetching liked outfits for user: abc123...
📁 Firestore path: users/abc123.../likedOutfits
📊 Query result - Total documents: 3
📄 Document: xyz123... { title: "...", ... }
📄 Document: xyz456... { title: "...", ... }
📄 Document: xyz789... { title: "...", ... }
✅ Successfully loaded 3 liked outfits
```

## Quick Smoke Test (1 minute) ⚡

If you're short on time, test this minimal flow:

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/style-check`, upload image
3. Click "Like" on all 3 outfits (should all turn green ✓)
4. Go to `/likes` (should show all 3 outfits)
5. Check console for errors (should be none)

**If all 5 steps pass, both fixes are working!** ✅

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Like button doesn't change to "Liked ✓"
**Check:**
- Console for error messages
- Network tab for failed Firestore requests
- User is signed in (not anonymous)

### Issue: Likes Page shows no outfits
**Check:**
- Console for query result: `📊 Query result - Total documents: X`
- If X = 0, outfits aren't saving (check save logs)
- If X > 0 but nothing displays, check data structure

### Issue: Hydration errors in console
**Check:**
- Import statements are static (not dynamic)
- No `DynamicTextPressure` or `DynamicSplashCursor` in code
- Components wrapped in `{isMounted && <Component />}`
